# Internship2019-Mock-up

Project Author: Frederick J. Miller

Mock-up of a web service interface using Django and Python, done during an internship with Ascension Information Services.

This mock-up was done in Django, written in Python and HTML, 
integrating the Bootstrap SB Admin 2 template. 

The purpose of this mock-up is to design a web interface for a device look-up service.

The user queries the service with either a unique device asset tag, with the device's 
IP address, or with the device’s serial number

The details of the device are then looked up from the database, and the information is displayed on the report page.

This project is designed to work with a postgreSQL database. Detailed instructions on how to implement one are in the DATABASES.md file.
