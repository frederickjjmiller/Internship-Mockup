Mock-up of a web service interface using Django and Python, done during an internship.

This mockup was done in Django, written in Python and HTML, 
integrating the Bootstrap SB Admin 2 template. 

The purpose of this mockup is to desigh a web interface for a device look-up service.

The user queries the service with either a unique device asset tag, or with the device's 
IP address.

The details of the device are then looked up from the database, and the information is displayed on the report page.
