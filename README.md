# Internship2019-Mockup
Mock-up of a web service interface using Django and Python, done during an internship wtih Ascension Information Services.

This Mockup was done in Django, with pythog and html. 

The purpose of this mockup was to design a web interface for a device look-up service. 

The user would query the website with either a unique asset tag, or with the device's IP address.

The device would then be looked up from the database, and the device's information would be displayed on the device report page.
